Gravity Capture is a lightweight Windows companion for Gravity List Bot. At set intervals it screenshots your screen or the active window, compresses it, and securely sends it to the botâ€™s ingest API to post in a chosen Discord channel. Configure interval, quality, and channel; authenticated via a shared key. (Full Log-bot features coming soon!)
